## Laze features

Laze has two main features.

### Native Language Programming

It is a feature that allows users to write programs in multiple languages such as Japanese and English, not programming languages.

Furthermore, it is our goal to make it possible for anyone to write programs in their native language by implementing functions in the library that can easily support multiple languages

### Without Environment Construction

We are currently developing an editor that functions in a browser. We are trying to further create extensions for offline editors like Visual Studio Code to create an environment where users can develop offline.

We are aming to reduce complicated steps and make the environment quick and easy to build.
