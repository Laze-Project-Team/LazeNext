# Operators

Items represented by symbols such as `+`, `-`, `=`, and `>` are collectively called "operators". Among them, those used for calculations are called "arithmetic operators," those used for comparing, matching, or disagreeing numerical values are called "comparison operators," and those used to create more complex conditional expressions by combining multiple conditional expressions are called "logical operators. (There is no need to force yourself to remember the names, though.)

## Arithmetic operators

|operator|name|example|function of the operator|
|---|---|---|---|
|`+`|addition|`a + b`|add b to a|
|`-`|subtraction|`a - b`|subtract b from a|
|`*`|multiplication|`a * b`|multiply a by b|
|`/`|division|`a / b`|divide a by b|
|`%`|surplus|`a % b`|a divided by b| remainder|

## Assignment Operators

|operator|name|example|function of the operator|
|---|---|---|---|
|`=`|assignment|`a = b`|assignment of b into a|
|`+=`|additive assignment|`a += b`|add b to a and assign it to a|
|`-=`|subtraction assignment|`a -= b`|subtract b from a and assign to a|
|`*=`|multiplication assignment|`a *= b`|multiply a by b and assign to a|
|`*=`|multiplication assignment|`a *= b`|multiply a by b and assign to a| |`/=`|division assignment|`a /= b`|divide a by b and assign to a|
|`/=`|division assignment|`a /= b`|divide a by b and assign to a| |`%=`|surplus assignment|`a %= b`|divide a by b and assign to a

Assigning to a means replacing the value of variable a with the value to be assigned.

## Comparison operators

|operator|example|function of the operator|
|---|---|---|
|`<`|`a < b`|if b is greater than a, it is true, otherwise it is false|
|`<=`|`a <= b`|if b is greater than a, or a and b are equal, then it is false unless true|
|`>`|`a > b`|b is less than a, otherwise false|
|`>=`|`a >= b`|false if b is less than a, or a and b are equal|
|`==`|`a == b`|false if not true if a and b are equal|

## Logical operators

|operator|name|example|function of the operator|
|---|---|---|---|
|`&&`|AND|`A && B`|false if A and B are not true|
|`\|\|`|OR|`A \|\| B`|False unless true if A or B|
|`! `|NOT|`!A`|False unless true if not A|

A or B here refers to a conditional expression such as `a == 1`.
