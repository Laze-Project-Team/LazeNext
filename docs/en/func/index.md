# Standard Features

Standard features are features that come as standard in Laze.

Currently, the following features are implemented.

Please refer to the [basic tutorial](/tutorial/basic) for basic programming instructions.

### [number](/func/number), [character](/func/char), [string](/func/string)

This section discusses basic value handling.

### [function](/func/function)

One of the most important concepts in learning Laze, functions are explained in detail.

### [control statements](/func/control)

A detailed explanation of one of the most important concepts in learning Laze, functions.
### [operator](/func/operator)

This section describes the [logical operators](/func/operator#Logical operators) used in [if statements](/func/control#if) and the [arithmetic operators](/func/operator#Arithmetic_operators) used in basic calculations.

### [class](/func/class)

This section describes classes, a useful feature that is also used in the Laze standard library. It is not mandatory, but it may help you to write more understandable code.
