# 3D Library Tutorial

Laze's 3D library makes it easy to draw 3D spaces. Let's learn how to use it in this tutorial!

## Basics

### Program

```
function:main () => () {
  // Set up mouse capture
	captureMouse();

  // World initialization
	Scene: world();

  // add cube
  double: cubeSize = 1.0;
	Vector3D: cubeCoordinates(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
	Vector3D: cubeColor (0.2, 0.5, 0.7);
	Integer: cubeID = world.addCube(cubeSize, cubeColor, cubeCoordinates);

  // Add light
  double: lightSize = 2.0;
	Vector3D: lightColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
	vector3D: lightCoordinates(5.0, 5.0, 5.0);
	int: lightID = world.addLight(lightSize, lightColor, lightCoordinates);

  // Set the rotation axis for rotation
	Vector3D: rotationAxis(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);

	loop {
    // rotate the sprite
		world.sprites.get(cubeID) -> rotate(rotationAxis, getTime() / 1000.0);

    // drawing process
		world.draw();
	}
}

```

### Explanation

#### line 3

It calls [captureMouse](/func/functions/captureMouse). This function allows you to capture the mouse in the canvas.

#### line 6

Initializing [Scene](/lib/3d/scene/index).

#### Lines 9-12

[Scene.addCube](/lib/3d/scene/addCube) is used to add a cube

#### lines 15-18

[Scene.addLight](/lib/3d/scene/addLight) to add a light.

#### line 21

Setting up the rotation axis for rotation.

#### line 25

[Model.rotate](/lib/3d/model/rotate) to rotate the cube.

To animate the rotation, we use [getTime](/func/functions/time)

#### line 28

[Scene.draw](/lib/3d/scene/draw) is used to draw the world.

#### Explanation of the flow

Initializing the scene will initialize the 3D world

[Scene2D](/lib/2d/scene/index) as well as [Scene.addCube](/lib/3d/scene/addCube) and [Scene.addLight](/lib/3d/scene/addLight) to add sprites to the scene.

You can also add sprites in an infinite loop using [Scene2D](/lib/2d/scene/index) as well as [scene. Sprites can be accessed from [Scene.sprites](/lib/3d/scene/sprites) as well as [Scene2D](/lib/2d/scene/index), and various operations can be performed on the sprites using the methods of [Model](/lib/3d/model/index).
